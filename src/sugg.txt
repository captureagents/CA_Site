Gotcha! So I checked the server and everything should be okay to connect. It seems to be working for other players.
My suggestions: 
Verify integrity of game files- a corrupt file could be causing errors 
Here's how to fix it.

Follow this tutorial on how to join the server. Don't use third party launchers like DayZSALauncher because users have had issues with these. 

Make sure BattleEye is running correctly- this is something that DayZ requires for servers to be joinable. Sometimes anti-virus and firewalls block it from running.
